# 19. Connecting to a database with Python

For this lesson, we will need to connect to our MySQL server. For this, we'll need the password we configured when we first installed MySQL server.

If you've forgotten the password, you might be able to reset it using instructions here:

We will also need a test database. The script for this is `create_test_db_script.sql`. Feel free to execute it in MySqlWorkbench before the class.
